1. Hyper TLS client to fetch announce and get peer list
2. Create some layer that will request blocks up to connection limit (probably can be a function now, with semaphore or some shit)
3. Calculate download speed.
4. Convert everything to same integer size -> probably i64/u64
4. Allow for bigger req queue -> request blocks from multiple pieces (maybe just keep score of how many req we can have for given peer)
5. Have actual piece picker - update info from bitsets, only request for pieces that peer have
6. Start working on download from multiple peers, run two clients on local net
7. Start seeding (should be realitvely easy now, just handle new msgs..)
8. Start timer when requesting piece, resend when not received in time..
9. Some simple ui in curses


Pass torrent file as argument to run..

PiecePicker plan:
collect list of pieces we have
